# ChessPiecePrediction
Implemented Machine Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks to predict chess pieces. 

## Overview
In this project we used the chessman image dataset from kaggle.com. The
dataset can be found here: [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/niteshfre/chessman-image-dataset/data) \
We wanted to use this data set to train and test different AI models and Techniques that result in
good prediction accuracy, and were able to be used to predict future images and classify them
into various chess piece categories.
